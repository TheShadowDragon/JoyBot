-- about --
This is a complete rewrite of my other bot called WearyBot. It was poorly made as I was just learning
python so I completely gave up on it to return a couple months later and make this one.

Wearybot also lacked features as it didn't have currency and was too crazy to make changes to the code.
I hope you all understand in the death of wearybot, But this one will rise up with more features and better optimization.
As always upon release this bot will be open source but for now I will only allow it in certain servers that I trust.

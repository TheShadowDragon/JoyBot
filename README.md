f*ck wearybot, JoyBot is my new best friend

coming soon to top.gg

# how to use this bot lol
in the same directory as the bot make sure you make a help.txt as well as a database folder and shop folder

# How do I add items to the shop?
create a file without an extention with the name of the item you want
then inside the file put a { "name":"name","price":"price"}

# How do I change the help screen?
The help menu is very easy to use as all you literally need a help.txt in the directory with some extra stuff.

The help menu has a feature called pages where if you type $help 1 it would take you to page 1.
The format to indicate the next page is a ^ for example *page 1 ^ page 2*
